Conclusion

Remember business problem! As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention and game rounds.

Firstly, we investigated relationships and structures in the data. There was no missing value problem but was one outlier problem in the data. Summary stats and plots help us to understand the data and problem.

Before A/B Testing, we shared some details about game, players, problems and suggestion to our customer/director/ceo etc.

After applying A/B Testing, the analysis result gives us some important information. Shapiro Testing rejected H0 for Normality assumption. Therefore we needed to apply a Non-parametric test as called Mann Whitney U to compare two groups. As a result, Mann Whitney U Testing rejected H0 hypothesis and we learned A/B groups are not similar!

Briefly, There are statistically significant difference between two groups about moving first gate from level 30 to level 40 for game rounds.

Which level has more advantages in terms of player retention? 1-day and 7-day average retention are higher when the gate is at level 30 than when it is at level 40.
